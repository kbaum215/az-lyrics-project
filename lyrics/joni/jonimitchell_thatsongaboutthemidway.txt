"That Song About The Midway"

I met you on a midway at a fair last yearAnd you stood out like a ruby in a black man's earYou were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar stringsYou were playing like a devil wearing wings, wearing wingsYou looked so grand wearing wingsDo you tape them to your shoulders just to singCan you flyI heard you can! Can you flyLike an eagle doin' your hunting from the skyI followed with the sideshows to another townAnd I found you in a trailer on the camping groundsYou were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the diceAnd I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twiceI heard your bid once or twiceWere you wondering was the gamble worth the pricePack it inI heard you did! Pack it inWas it hard to fold a hand you knew could winSo lately you've been hiding - it was somewhere in the newsAnd I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my bluesAnd a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mineAnd I feel like I've been working overtime, overtimeI've lost my fire overtimeAlways playin' one more hand for one more dimeSlowin' down I'm gettin' tired!Slowin' downAnd I envy you the valley that you've found'Cause I'm midway down the midwaySlowin' down, down, down, down
