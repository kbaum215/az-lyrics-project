"Sisotowbell Lane"

Sisotowbell LaneNoah is fixing the pump in the rainHe brings us no shameWe always knew that he always knewUp over the hillJovial neighbors come down when they willWith stories to tellSometimes they doYes sometimes we doWe have a rocking chairEach of us rocks his shareEating muffin buns and berriesBy the steamy kitchen windowSometimes we doOur tongues turn blueSisotowbell LaneAnywhere else now would seem very strangeThe seasons are changingEveryday in everywaySometimes it is springSometimes it is not anythingA poet can singSometimes we tryYes we always tryWe have a rocking chairSomedays we rock and stareAt the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the riverSometimes we doWe like the viewSisotowbell LaneGo to the city you'll come back againTo wade thru the grainYou always doYes we always doCome back to the starsSweet well water and pickling jarsWe'll lend you the carWe always doYes sometimes we doWe have a rocking chairSomeone is always thereRocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the windowSometimes we doWe wait for you
