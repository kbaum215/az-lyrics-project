"Conversation"

He comes for conversationI comfort him sometimesComfort and consultationHe knows that's what he'll findI bring him apples and cheesesHe brings me songs to playHe sees me when he pleasesI see him in cafesAnd I only say, helloAnd turn away before his lady knowsHow much I want to see himShe removes him, like a ringTo wash her handsShe only brings him out to show her friendsI want to free himSecrets and sharing sodaThat's how our time beganLove is a story told to a friendIt's second handBut I'll listen to his questionsI'll give my answers when they're foundHe says she keeps him guessingBut I know she keeps him downShe speaks in sorry sentencesMiraculous repentancesI don't believe herTomorrow he will come to meAnd he'll speak his sorrow endlessly and he'll ask me whyWhy can't I leave her?He comes for conversationI comfort him sometimesComfort and consultationHe knows that's what he'll findHe knows that's what... he'll find
