"Willy"

Willy is my child, he is my fatherI would be his lady all my lifeHe says he'd love to live with meBut for an ancient injuryThat has not healedHe said I feel once againLike I gave my heart too soonHe stood looking through the laceAt the face on the conquered moonAnd counting all the cars up the hillAnd the stars on my window sillThere are still more reasons whyI love himWilly is my joy, he is my sorrowNow he wants to run away and hideHe says our love cannot be realHe cannot hear the chapel's pealing silver bellsBut you know it's hard to tellWhen you're in the spell if it's wrong or if it's realBut you're bound to loseIf you let the blues get you scared to feelAnd I feel like I'm just being bornLike a shiny light breaking in a stormThere are so many reasons why I love himWilly is my child, he is my father
