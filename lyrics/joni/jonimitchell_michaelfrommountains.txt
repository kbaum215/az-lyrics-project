"Michael From Mountains"

Michael wakes you up with sweetsHe takes you up streets and the rain comes downSidewalk markets locked up tightAnd umbrellas bright on a grey backgroundThere's oil on the puddles in taffeta patternsThat run down the drainIn colored arrangementsThat Michael will change with a stick that he foundMichael from mountainsGo where you will go toKnow that I will know youSomeday I may know you very wellMichael brings you to a parkHe sings and it's dark when the clouds come byYellow slickers up on swingsLike puppets on strings hanging in the skyThey'll splash home to suppers in wallpapered kitchensTheir mothers will scoldBut Michael will hold youTo keep away cold till the sidewalks are dry-Michael from mountainsGo where you will go toKnow that I will know youSomeday I may know you very wellMichael leads you up the stairsHe needs you to care and you know you doCats come crying to the keyAnd dry you will be in a towel or twoThere's rain in the windowThere's sun in the painting that smiles on the wallYou want to know allBut his mountains have called so you never do-Michael from mountainsGo where you will go toKnow that I will know youSomeday I may know you very well
