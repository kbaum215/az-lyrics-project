"Nathan La Franeer"

I hired a coach to take me from confusion to the planeAnd though we shared a common space I know I'll never meet againThe driver with his eyebrows furrowed in the rear-view mirrorI read his name and it was plainly written Nathan La FraneerI asked him would he hurryBut we crawled the canyons slowlyThru the buyers and the sellersThru the burglar bells and the wishing wellsWith gangs and girly showsThe ghostly garden growsThe cars and buses bustled thru the bedlam of the dayI looked thru window-glass at streets and Nathan grumbled at the greyI saw an aging cripple selling Superman balloonsThe city grated thru chrome-plateThe clock struck slowly half-past-noonThru the tunnel tiled and turningInto daylight once again I am escapingOnce again goodbyeTo symphonies and dirty treesWith parks and plastic clothesThe ghostly garden growsHe asked me for a dollar moreHe cursed me to my faceHe hated everyone who paid to rideAnd share his common spaceI picked my bags up from the curbAnd stumbled to the doorAnother man reached out his handAnother hand reached out for moreAnd I filled it full of silverAnd I left the fingers countingAnd the sky goes on foreverWithout meter maids and peace paradesYou feed it all your woesThe ghostly garden grows
