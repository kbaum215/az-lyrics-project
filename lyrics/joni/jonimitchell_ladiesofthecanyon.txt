"Ladies Of The Canyon"

Trina wears her wampum beadsShe fills her drawing book with linesSewing lace on widows' weedsAnd filigree on leaf and vineVine and leaf are filigreeAnd her coat's a second-hand oneTrimmed with antique luxuryShe is a lady of the canyonAnnie sits you down to eatShe always makes you welcome inCats and babies 'round her feetAnd all are fat and none are thinNone are thin and all are fatShe may bake some brownies todaySaying, you are welcome backShe is another canyon ladyEstrella circus girlComes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawlsSongs like tiny hammers hurledAt beveled mirrors in empty hallsEmpty halls and beveled mirrorsSailing seas and climbing banyansCome out for a visit hereTo be a lady of the canyonTrina takes her paints and her threadsAnd she weaves a pattern all her ownAnnie bakes her cakes and her breadsAnd she gathers flowers for her homeFor her home she gathers flowersAnd Estrella, dear companionColors up the sunshine hoursPouring music down the canyonColoring the sunshine hoursThey are the ladies of the canyon
