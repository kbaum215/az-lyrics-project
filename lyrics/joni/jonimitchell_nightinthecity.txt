"Night In The City"

Light up light upLight up your lazy blue eyesMoon's up nights upTaking the town by surpriseNight time night timeDay left an hour agoCity light timeMust you get ready so slowThere are places to come from and places to goNight in the city looks pretty to meNight in the city looks fineMusic comes spilling out into the streetColors go flashing in timeTake off take offTake off your stay-at-home shoesBreak off shake offChase off those stay-at-home bluesStairway stairwayDown to the crowds in the streetThey go their wayLooking for faces to greetBut we run on laughing with no one to meetNight in the city looks pretty to meNight in the city looks fineMusic comes spilling out into the streetColors go waltzing in time
