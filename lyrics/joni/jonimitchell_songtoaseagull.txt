"Song To A Seagull"

Fly silly seabirdNo dreams can possess youNo voices can blame youFor sun on your wingsMy gentle relationsHave names they must call meFor loving the freedomOf all flying thingsMy dreams with the seagulls flyOut of reach out of cryI came to the cityAnd lived like old CrusoeOn an island of noiseIn a cobblestone seaAnd the beaches were concreteAnd the stars paid a light billAnd the blossoms hung falseOn their store window treesMy dreams with the seagulls flyOut of reach out of cryOut of the cityAnd down to the seasideTo sun on my shouldersAnd wind in my hairBut sandcastles crumbleAnd hunger is humanAnd humans are hungryFor worlds they can't shareMy dreams with the seagulls flyOut of reach out of cryI call to a seagullWho dives to the watersAnd catches his silver-fineDinner aloneCrying where are the footprintsThat danced on these beachesAnd the hands that cast wishesThat sunk like a stoneMy dreams with the seagulls flyOut of reach, out of cry
