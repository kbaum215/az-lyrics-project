"The Dawntreader"

Peridots and periwinkle blue medallionsGilded galleons spilled across the ocean floorTreasure somewhere in the sea and he will find whereNever mind their questions there's no answer forThe roll of the harbor wakeThe songs that the rigging makesThe taste of the spray he takesAnd he learns to giveHe aches and he learns to liveHe stakes all his silverOn a promise to be freeMermaids live in coloniesAll his seadreams come to meCity satins left at home I will not need themI believe him when he tells of loving meSomething truthful in the sea your lies will find youLeave behind your streets he said and come to meCome down from the neon nightsCome down from the tourist sightsRun down till the rain delights youYou do not hideSunlight will renew your prideSkin white by skin goldenLike a promise to be freeDolphins playing in the seaAll his seadreams come to meSeabird I have seen you fly above the pilingsI am smiling at your circles in the airI will come and sit by you while he lies sleepingFold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to shareA dream that you love someoneA dream that the wars are doneA dream that you tell no one but the grey seaThey'll say that you're crazyAnd a dream of a babyLike a promise to be freeChildren laughing out to seaAll his seadreams come to me
