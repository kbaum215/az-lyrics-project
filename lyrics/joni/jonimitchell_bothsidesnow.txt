"Both Sides Now"

Rows and floes of angel hairAnd ice cream castles in the airAnd feather canyons everywhereI've looked at clouds that wayBut now they only block the sunThey rain and snow on everyoneSo many things I would have doneBut clouds got in my wayI've looked at clouds from both sides nowFrom up and down, and still somehowIt's cloud illusions I recallI really don't know clouds at allMoons and Junes and Ferris wheelsThe dizzy dancing way you feelAs every fairy tale comes realI've looked at love that wayBut now it's just another showYou leave 'em laughing when you goAnd if you care, don't let them knowDon't give yourself awayI've looked at love from both sides nowFrom give and take, and still somehowIt's love's illusions I recallI really don't know love at allTears and fears and feeling proudTo say "I love you" right out loudDreams and schemes and circus crowdsI've looked at life that wayBut now old friends are acting strangeThey shake their heads, they say I've changedWell something's lost, but something's gainedIn living every dayI've looked at life from both sides nowFrom win and lose and still somehowIt's life's illusions I recallI really don't know life at allI've looked at life from both sides nowFrom up and down, and still somehowIt's life's illusions I recallI really don't know life at all
