"For Free"

I slept last night in a good hotelI went shopping today for jewelsThe wind rushed around in the dirty townAnd the children let out from the schoolsI was standing on a noisy cornerWaiting for the walking greenAcross the street he stoodAnd he played real goodOn his clarinet for freeNow me I play for fortunesAnd those velvet curtain callsI got a black limousine and two gentlemenEscorting me to the hallsAnd I play if you have the moneyOr if you're a friend to meBut the one man bandBy the quick lunch standHe was playing real good for freeNobody stopped to hear himThough he played so sweet and highThey knew he had never been on their TVSo they passed his music byI meant to go over and ask for a songMaybe put on a harmonyI heard his refrainAs the signal changedHe was playing real good for free
