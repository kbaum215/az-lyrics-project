"Chelsea Morning"

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heardWas a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the wordsIt came a-reeling up like Christmas bells, and rapping up like pipes and drumsOh, won't you stayWe'll put on the dayAnd we'll wear it 'till the night comesWoke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I sawWas the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wallBlue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckonOh, won't you stayWe'll put on the dayThere's a sun show every secondNow the curtain opens on a portrait of todayAnd the streets are paved with passersbyAnd pigeons flyAnd papers lieWaiting to blow awayWoke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knewThere was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, tooAnd the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my sensesOh, won't you stayWe'll put on the dayAnd we'll talk in present tensesWhen the curtain closes and the rainbow runs awayI will bring you incense owls by nightBy candlelightBy jewel-lightIf only you will stayPretty baby, won't youWake up, it's a Chelsea morning
