"I Think I Understand"

Daylight falls upon the path, the forest falls behindToday I am not prey to dark uncertaintyThe shadow trembles in its wrath, I've robbed its blackness blindAnd tasted sunlight as my fear came clear to meI think I understandFear is like a wilderlandStepping stones or sinking sandNow the way leads to the hills, above the steeple's chimeBelow me sleepy rooftops round the harborIt's there I'll take my thirsty fill of friendship over wineForgetting fear but never disregarding herOh, I think I understandFear is like a wilderlandStepping stones and sinking sandSometimes voices in the night will call me back againBack along the pathway of a troubled mindWhen forests rise to block the light that keeps a traveler saneI'll challenge them with flashes from a brighter timeOh, I think I understandFear is like a wilderlandStepping stones or sinking sand
