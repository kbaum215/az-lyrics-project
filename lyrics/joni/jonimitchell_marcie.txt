"Marcie"

Marcie in a coat of flowersStops inside a candy storeReds are sweet and greens are sourStill no letter at her doorSo she'll wash her flower curtainsHang them in the wind to dryDust her tables with his shirt andWave another day goodbyeMarcie's faucet needs a plumberMarcie's sorrow needs a manRed is autumn green is summerGreens are turning and the sandAll along the ocean beachesStares up empty at the skyMarcie buys a bag of peachesStops a postman passing byAnd summer goesFalls to the sidewalk like string and brown paperWinter blowsUp from the river there's no one to take herTo the seaMarcie dresses warm it's snowingTakes a yellow cab uptownRed is stop and green's for goingSees a show and rides back downDown along the Hudson RiverPast the shipyards in the coldStill no letter's been deliveredStill the winter days unfoldLike magazinesFading in dusty grey attics and cellarsMake a dreamDream back to summer and hear how he tells herWait for meMarcie leaves and doesn't tell usWhere or why she moved awayRed is angry green is jealousThat was all she had to saySomeone thought they saw her SundayWindow shopping in the rainSomeone heard she bought a one-way ticketAnd went west again
