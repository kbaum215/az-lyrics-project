"Cactus Tree"

There's a man who's been out sailingIn a decade full of dreamsAnd he takes her to a schoonerAnd he treats her like a queenBearing beads from CaliforniaWith their amber stones and greenHe has called her from the harborHe has kissed her with his freedomHe has heard her off to starboardIn the breaking and the breathingOf the water weedsWhile she was busy being freeThere's a man who's climbed a mountainAnd he's calling out her nameAnd he hopes her heart can hearThree thousand miles he calls againHe can think her there beside himHe can miss her just the sameHe has missed her in the forestWhile he showed her all the flowersAnd the branches sang the chorusAs he climbed the scaly towersOf a forest treeWhile she was somewhere being freeThere's a man who's sent a letter and he's waiting for replyHe has asked her of her travels since the day they said goodbyeHe writes, "Wish you were beside me, we can make it if we try."He has seen her at the officeWith her name on all these papersThrough the sharing of the profitsHe will find it hard to shake herFrom his memoryAnd she's so busy being freeThere's a lady, in the cityAnd she thinks she loves them allThere's the one who's thinking of herThere's the one who sometimes callsThere's the one who writes her lettersWith his facts and figures scrawlShe has brought them to her sensesThey have laughed inside her laughterNow she rallies her defensesFor she fears that one will ask herFor eternityAnd she's so busy being freeThere's a man who sends her medalsHe is bleeding from the warThere's a jouster and a jesterAnd a man who owns a storeThere's a drummer, and a dreamerAnd you know there may be moreShe will love them when she sees themThey will lose her if they followAnd she only means to please themAnd her heart is full and hollowLike a cactus treeWhile she's so busy being freeLike a cactus treeBeing free
