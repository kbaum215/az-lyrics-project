"I Had A King"

I had a king in a tenement castleLately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brownHe's taken the curtains downHe's swept with the broom of contemptAnd the rooms have an empty ringHe's cleaned with the tearsOf an actor who fears for the laughter's stingI can't go back there anymoreYou know my keys won't fit the doorYou know my thoughts don't fit the manThey never can they never canI had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisleyLately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blindHe lives in another timeLadies in gingham still blushWhile he sings them of wars and wineBut I in my leather and laceI can never become that kindI can't go back there anymoreYou know my keys won't fit the doorYou know my thoughts don't fit the manThey never can they never canI had a king in a salt-rusted carriageWho carried me off to his country for marriage too soonBeware of the power of moonsThere's no one to blameNo there's no one to name as a traitor hereThe king's on the roadAnd the queen's in the grove till the end of the yearI can't go back there anymoreYou know my keys won't fit the doorYou know my thoughts don't fit the manThey never can they never canThey never can they never can
