"Tin Angel"

Varnished weeds in window jarsTarnished beads on tapestriesKept in satin boxes areReflections of love's memoriesLetters from across the seasRoses dipped in sealing waxValentines and maple leavesTucked into a paperbackGuess I'll throw them all awayI found someone to love todayDark with darker moods is heNot a golden Prince who's comeThrough columbines and wizardryTo talk of castles in the sunStill I'll take a chance and seeI found someone to love todayThere's a sorrow in his eyesLike the angel made of tinWhat will happen if I tryTo place another heart in himIn a Bleecker Street cafeI found someone to love todayI found someone to love today
