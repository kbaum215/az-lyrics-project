"The Gallery"

When I first saw your galleryI liked the ones of ladiesThen you began to hang up meYou studied to portray meIn ice and greensAnd old blue jeansAnd naked in the rosesThen you got into funny scenesThat all your work discloses"Lady, don't love me now I am deadI am a saint, turn down your bedI have no heart," that's what you saidYou said, "I can be cruelBut let me be gentle with you"Somewhere in a magazineI found a page about youI see that now it's JosephineWho cannot be without youI keep your house in fit repairI dust the portraits dailyYour mail comes here from everywhereThe writing looks like ladies'"Lady, please love me now, I am deadI am a saint, turn down your bedI have no heart," that's what you saidYou said, "I can be cruelBut let me be gentle with you"I gave you all my pretty yearsThen we began to weatherAnd I was left to winter hereWhile you went west for pleasureAnd now you're flying back this wayLike some lost homing pigeonThey've monitored your brain, you sayAnd changed you with religion"Lady, please love me now I was deadI am no saint, turn down your bedLady, have you no heart," that's what you saidWell, I can be cruelBut let me be gentle with youWhen I first saw your galleryI liked the ones of ladiesBut now their faces follow meAnd all their eyes look shady
