"Morning Morgantown"

When morning comes to MorgantownThe merchants roll their awnings downThe milktrucks make their morning roundsIn morning MorgantownWe'll rise up early, with the sunTo ride the bus while everyone is yawningAnd the day is youngIn morning MorgantownMorning MorgantownBuy your dreams a dollar downMorning any town you nameMorning's just the sameWe'll find a table in the shadeAnd sip our tea and lemonadeAnd watch the morning on paradeIn morning MorgantownLadies in their rainbow fashionsColored stop and go lights flashingWe'll wink at total strangers passingIn morning MorgantownMorning MorgantownBuy your dreams a dollar downMorning any town you nameMorning's just the sameI'd like to buy you everythingA wooden bird with painted wingsA window full of colored ringsIn morning MorgantownBut the only thing I have to giveTo make you smile, to win you withAre all the mornings still to liveIn morning Morgantown
